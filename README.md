## About
Gambit is a project designed to let me practice some of the concepts I've been researching regarding live-service titles at a quick pace. The project itself is designed to be a tactical RPG.

## To-Do
- [ ] Spawn Characters on Map
- [ ] Character Movement
- [ ] Display Movable Squares
- [ ] Decide How to Represent Character Data
- [ ] Gacha :^)

## Thoughts
My current thought process is to have the gameplay rendered on the client, with the server holding authority and validating the movement and actions inside the game. My original plan was to make a seperate place for gameplay inside of the ~~universe~~ experience[^1], but with the data caching and general networking concerns, I didn't feel as though that was the best course of action. 

[^1]: It's always going to be 'universe' to me.
